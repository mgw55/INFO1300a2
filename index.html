				<h3> Tru Kanye Qwotes </h3>
				<p> "They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus, that means guns, sex, lies, video tapes, but if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?"
				<br><br>
				"Whoa by 50 percent [I am more influential than] Stanley Kubrick, Apostle Paul, Picasso... f****** Picasso and Escobar. By 50 per cent more influential than any other human being."
				<br><br>
				"I am God's vessel. But my greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live."

				<h3> Kanye Lyfe Lessons </h3>
				<p>
					So, the voices in my head told me go, and then I just walked up, like, halfway up the stage... But I just didn't really want to take away from Beck's moment, or the time he's having to talk. It was kind of a joke - like the Grammys themselves.
					<br><br>
					Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and so self-absorbed. I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book's autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books.
					<br><br>
					I hate when I'm on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle.
